Experimental Webdriver Binding/port for ColdFusion

Installation Version 1: 

1. Put all the jars from /lib into WEB-INF/lib/webdriver
2. Edit WEB-INF/web.xml adding the path to the webdriver jars above
to the BEGINING of the cf.class.path element:  

<context-param id="coldfusion_context_88">
    <param-name>cf.class.path</param-name>
    <param-value>
     ./WEB-INF/lib/webdriver,./WEB-INF/cfusion/lib/updates,./WEB-INF/cfusion/lib,./WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/lib,./WEB-INF/flex/jars,./WEB-INF/cfform/jars</param-value>
</context-param>

This is needed to make sure the commons logging classes are loaded first and
override ColdFusion's logging.  NOTE: I don't know how this affects CF logging
or other apps. It might be best to create a new CF instance for this kind of
app or web testing ...

3. Restart CF.
4. Try the tests in ClassDirLoading.cfc

To Do: Write CFC wrappers for Webdriver classes. Factor method maybe to return
specified driver (FF,IE,HtmlUnit) ... Need to be able to swap out drivers quickly.
